# Screen clamp for Mercedes-Benz A class 2012

## Version 5

With a hook on the top right corner of the clamp to assist the removing of it.

Panel is made narrower as space allows.

## Version 4

## Version 3 (broken)

Panel is widened and thickened to remove twisting. Connecting panel and left side of
the clamp increases support. Top side of the clamp widened 3x to remove lateral raises.

Right side of the clamp broke when it falls to the floor: it is vulnerable due to total
mass increase.

## Version 2 (broken)

Too tight on screen height. Panel too thin and narrow, twisting with mounted phone.
Also wrongly copied connector to quad-lock (inner circle must be cut-out).

## Version 1 (broken)

Initial design, was a bit loose on a screen place.
